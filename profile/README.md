## 👋 Hello fellow traveller

"Life is naturally unfair, but we are capable of making it artificially fair."

## 📖 About Us

Welcome to Folhas Cadentes, also known as the Association for Innovation in Computer Accessibility (AICA). We are a non-profit group based in Cascavel, Paraná, Brazil, working tirelessly to make the digital world fair for everyone.

Our name, "Folhas Cadentes", is a rich metaphor that reflects our mission and values. The "folhas" or leaves, symbolize growth, renewal, and interconnectedness. Just like leaves are essential parts of a tree, each member of our association is a vital part of the whole, contributing to the collective growth and prosperity. Moreover, leaves have cycles—they are born, they grow, and they fall—symbolizing constant evolution and adaptation to change, which are essential in the field of digital accessibility.

The term "cadentes" or falling, brings to mind the image of a falling star, often associated with making a wish or fulfilling a desire. This reflects our aspiration to bring about significant improvements in digital accessibility, acting as a "falling star" in the sense of inspiring positive change and fulfilling the "wishes" of a more inclusive and accessible society.

Together, we form a "falling star" of leaves, working towards achieving something greater. We are here to help, but the real stars are the people we are trying to help.

## 🎯 Our Mission

Our mission is to improve accessibility in computer systems. We do this by developing innovative projects, setting accessibility standards, and promoting awareness and digital inclusion.
